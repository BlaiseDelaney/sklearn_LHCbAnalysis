# sklearn_LHCbAnalysis
Scikit-Learn MVA for LHCb Analysis


## To-Do list:

- Create Class/Wrapper to pass Plotter, Train, Test
- Member functions for plotting, in particular hists for branches with kws and args (range etc..)
- Rename Branches
- A metric to evalue how much the corrected mass error biases the mva output to artificially create
  a tail in the mass range of the Bc (with all D resonances decay paths)
- LaTeX implementation for plots
- Progress for trainig
- Debug and report modes
- make_html.py-like script
